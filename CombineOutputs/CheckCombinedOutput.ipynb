world.\\ni have been commissioned by drax power station to write an opinion piece in support of the entire bioenergy sector that will be distributed to the brussels press next week. the intention is that this will be read by meps prior to the vote. i have circulated this amongst academics working in the field of bioenergy and got widespread support from across the world.\\nhere is the letter in full:\\non the 17th january meps should vote to recognise the importance of bioenergy in meeting the eu’s renewable energy and climate change targets.\\namongst the renewable energy options bioenergy has unique potential to deliver significant benefits to society and the environment.\\nbioenergy is one of the most affordable renewable energy technologies. it is available in solid, liquid and gaseous forms and can be used for power, heating and transport. sources of bioenergy are plentiful and can bring wealth and jobs to rural areas across the world and enable profit to be derived from marginal land. bioenergy projects can create markets for low value roundwood and residues and therefore reduce waste. bioenergy fuels are indispensable in that they can be easily stored so when demand is high they can be mobilised as soon as they are required. as a result of all this, bioenergy can meet needs not readily met by other renewables and provide grid stability on cloudy or windless days.\\nto be a positive part of an integrated approach to tackling climate change bioenergy feedstocks should be obtained from sustainable sources and not lead to the destruction of primary forest or land designated for nature protection. the production pathway for bioenergy fuels needs to be able to meet strict greenhouse emissions thresholds compared to fossil fuels to ensure that tangible carbon reduction is achieved. stringent air quality standards must be adopted, implemented and regulated to ensure that any adverse effects to human health are minimised and bad practice is eliminated. more trees and perennial energy crops need to be planted than harvested in order to guard against any potential carbon debt, a scenario in which things get worse before they get better.\\nthe amendments to the renewable energy directive (red) adopted by the environment committee reinforce the requirement for a productive, sustainable and well-regulated bioenergy industry. the amendments seek to raise the bar and present bioenergy sustainability with even greater importance. even in advance of the red amendments governments across europe and industry bodies are already adopting more stringent approaches that ensure that there is greater traceability, accuracy, transparency and reliability in bioenergy reporting.\\nthe bioenergy sector has its detractors particularly amongst environmental ngos who tend to present only the worst case scenarios without looking at any of the multifarious benefits that bioenergy can provide. most anti-bioenergy reports focus on three main arguments: 1) bioenergy creates a market that is serviced by the felling of whole trees and entire forests; 2) felling a tree for bioenergy and planting another to replace it leads to a carbon debt that takes many decades to be repaid; 3) combustion of wood chip leads to higher emissions of nitrogen oxides (nox) and particulates (pm) that can lead to premature deaths.\\nall three of these common concerns can be dealt with. in 2016 only 3.3% of biomass harvested in the south east u.s was used for pellet production for renewable power. this is because bioenergy is generally a co-product of the forest industry, and is not the primary driver of forest management and harvest decisions. saw-logs are sold to high value markets to maximize profit and only the lower grade and lower value material is used for bioenergy.\\nin most countries less than 2% of productive forests are felled each year leaving 98% to assimilate atmospheric carbon released from any bioenergy combustion. in addition, in the us and europe forests are growing faster than they are being felled, with growth being driven by markets. this is providing an increase in carbon stocks through the larger area of forested land and because younger stands/forests absorb more carbon than mature ones. furthermore, the anticipated future development of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (ccus) technologies will enable some bioenergy pathways to achieve negative emissions.\\nwith regards to air quality it is very difficult to identify the impacts of bioenergy combustion in isolation. road transport particularly from diesel vehicles is a much greater source of pm and nox pollutants. if anything these pollutants are likely to fall in the future with stricter emissions standards being adopted, as abatement technologies improve and transport is decarbonised. in any case, an increase in demand for bioenergy is likely to improve forest management practices and stimulate more planting of woodland and perennial energy crops. the former can help reduce forest fires whilst additional wooded land cover can help improve water quality and increase flood defence. all of these will protect human life.\\nwe believe that bioenergy has to be an essential part of the eu energy mix for at least the next 30 years. without bioenergy and ccus technologies the cop21 commitment for a 1.5 degree reduction will be very hard, if not impossible to achieve. the negative impacts on the climate and society from such a failure will be significant for humans and biodiversity. however at the same time we clearly need to promote good practice in a well-regulated bioenergy industry that ensures it is done well. we therefore urge meps to vote in favour of red amendments that will consolidate bioenergy at the centre of eu renewable energy policy.\\nin total 63 academics from around the world signed the letter. these are listed below in the order in which they responded:\\ndr astley hastings, senior

productivity in the us south\\n2017 draft rpa tables, us forest service – in 2016 harvesting for wood products in the us south (224 million m3) represented just 2.67% of the total working forest volume (8.385 billion m3 timberland growing stock).\\nfaostat – of the total us harvest in 2016 (402 million m3) just 3.3% (13.4 million tonnes) was used for pellet production and only 2.5% (9.9 million tonnes) for export pellets. note: pellet production and export data, conversion to cubic metres of wood used assumes 2.1 m3/tonne pellets.\\nforest inventory and analysis national program major trends – “harvesting affects nearly 10 million acres in the u.s. annually, or about 1.3% of all forest land.”\\ntree planting in the uk house of commons debate pack 2 december 2016 – “the area of woodland in the uk at 31 march 2016 is 3.16 million hectares. 6,000 ha of newly created woodland were reported in the uk in 2015-16. 14,000 ha of woodland restocking were reported in the uk in 2015-16” (as a requirement of felling licenses). as a result only 0.44% of forests were felled.\\nforest wood – the forest and sustainable forestry – “the growth in the standing volume of wood is greater than the amount felled, and has been for the entire 20th century onwards. annual growth stands at around 120 million forest cubic metres, and each year around 90 million forest cubic metres of that growth is harvested. in other words, the amount of forest in sweden is constantly growing year on year, with the total volume of wood amounting to over 3 billion forest cubic metres!”\\nabout kevin lindegaard\\nkevin lindegaard has 21 years experience working in the field of energy crops and renewable energy. his knowledge is very widespread covering policy, biomass production, processing, logistics and end use. he has intimate knowledge of the energy crops sector at the micro scale as well as the bigger picture. his work is well respected in the uk and abroad. since 2015 he has been a director of wood heat association (the uk trade body) providing input on energy crops and non-woody sources of biomass. he spent 7 years working at long ashton research station as the plant breeder in
