we encourage our clients to meet insurers
back to case studies page
brunel’s client is a geotechnical surveyor/expert witness. this long standing client is a complex risk, and with renewal approaching, the holding insurer suffered a crisis of appetite and confidence, and advised they would not be offering renewal terms.
brunel visited the client mid-term to candidly discuss strategies (even picking up a water sample from
one of his clients on the way as he needed it urgently to test!).
we arranged for the client to attend our london offices to meet with key underwriters face to face, to discuss his business and so that they could gain a better understanding of the services he provided.
the insurers were so impressed that three of them wanted our client to act as an expert witness on other claims matters.
the client renewed their policy and complimented us on our fantastic service across the board. he commented that until he came to brunel he had always viewed insurance brokers in a negative light but no more!

what am i worth? indoor creation week
starting life as an outdoor show, last week we headed back in to the rehearsal room with extraordinary bodies and project partners diverse city to reimagine what am i worth? for indoor spaces in 2020.
working with lighting designer james loudon, ‘rose’ (our affectionately named bespoke spinning steel wheel) took on a whole new presence and energy indoors. bringing together some of the original cast members with new artists we created some beautifully atmospheric, visual and dynamic new moments which were captured by filmmaker steven lake for a brand-new trailer to be released soon. watch this space!
what am i worth? is now booking for mid-scale indoor spaces and outdoor spaces for 2020. please contact producer claire teasdale for more information claireteasdale@extraordinarybodies.org.uk

cirque bijou present high wire finale show at sirf 2017
to celebrate 30 years of stockton international riverside festival we presented a unique and breathtaking high wire finale show which brought the festival to a memorable close on the sunday night.
the show, alive with colour, flame and song, featured world renowned high wire artists jade kindar martin, johanne humblet, and the incredible bullzini family. to top off the show jade performed his incredible and daring fire wire act which involved him walked and riding a bike over a flaming high wire, a one of a kind dramatic crescendo not seen anywhere else in this world.
live music was played by diana yukawa, michael fergie, and a fantastic local choir sang as part of the finale. we also had 25 young local dancers volunteer to dance with our led umbrellas as part of the spectacle.
thanks to everyone involved, we are truly honoured to have headlined such a prestigious festival.
“the show was amazing – just what we wanted and no one was disappointed. the show was beautiful, gentle and spectacular with extraordinary performances. our volunteers were worked hard and loved every minute of their participation. please pass on our huge thanks to the performers and your team.”

description
the kamasan b940 is an almost cult hook pattern which has been popular with both match and pleasure anglers for many years.
the long shank and round bend make the kamasan b940 a very good hook pattern for using with worm baits. the smaller sizes are deadly for flatties and other smaller species whilst the bigger hooks work well for cod and bass.
the chemically etched needle point is super sharp helping to convert bites into landed fish. the medium gauge wire gives strength allowing you to comfortably play larger fish on even the smallest sized hooks.
they have a black finish and a small neat eye to aid baiting up with worm baits.
if you tie a lot of rigs then the kamasan b940 box of 100 offers a great way of stocking up on these popular hooks.

don't invest unless you're prepared to lose all the money you invest. this is a high-risk investment and you are unlikely to be protected if something goes wrong. take 2 mins to learn more.
×
estimated reading time: 2 min
due to the potential for losses, the financial conduct authority (fca) considers this investment to be high risk.
what are the key risks?
1. you could lose all the money you invest
• if the business you invest in fails, you are likely to lose 100% of the money you invested. most start-up businesses fail.
2. you are unlikely to be protected if something goes wrong
• protection from the financial services compensation scheme (fscs), in relation to claims against failed regulated firms, does not cover poor investment performance. try the fscs investment protection checker here.
• protection from the financial ombudsman service (fos) does not cover poor investment performance. if you have a complaint against an fca-regulated firm, fos may be able to consider it. learn more about fos protection here.
3. you won’t get your money back quickly
• even if the business you invest in is successful, it may take several years to get your money back. you are unlikely to be able to sell your investment early.
• the most likely way to get your money back is if the business is bought by another business or lists its shares on an exchange such as the london stock exchange. these events are not common.
• if you are investing in a start-up business, you should not expect to get your money back through dividends. start-up businesses rarely pay these.
4. don’t put all your eggs in one basket
• putting all your money into a single business or type of investment for example, is risky. spreading your money across different investments makes you less dependent on any one to do well.
• a good rule of thumb is not to invest more than 10% of your money in high-risk investments.
5. the value of your investment can be reduced
• the percentage of the business that you own will decrease if the business issues more shares. this could mean that the value of your investment reduces, depending on how much the business grows. most start-up businesses issue multiple rounds of shares.
• these new shares could have additional rights that your shares don’t have, such as the right to receive a fixed dividend, which could further reduce your chances of getting a return on your investment.
if you are interested in learning more about how to protect yourself, visit the fca’s website here.
